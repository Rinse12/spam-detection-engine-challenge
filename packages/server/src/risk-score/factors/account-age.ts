 * Does NOT trust author.subplebbit.firstCommentTimestamp or comment.timestamp because:
 * - A malicious subplebbit can fabricate firstCommentTimestamp
 * - A subplebbit owner can backdate their own comments' timestamp field
 * - We cannot detect subplebbit ownership at the protocol level
 *
 * Tradeoff: Account age reflects how long the author has been known to our system,
 * not their actual Plebbit history. This is acceptable for security.
 *
 * Scoring logic:
 * - Older accounts are considered more trustworthy (lower risk)
 * - New accounts are higher risk as they haven't built a reputation
 * - Accounts with no history in our system are treated as brand new (highest risk)
