- All packages require Node.js v22+
- If you update the code and it differs than our spec at README.md, ask me if we need to update the spec to follow the implementation

- Make sure to run npm run build after you're done coding and make sure it passes. Run it for all packages

- Both challenges and http server engine will be run in nodejs environment and never in browser.
- When you add a feature make sure to add tests to test that feature using vitest.
- If there's a bug then you should reproduce it with a test and then fix it in code, then run the test and make sure it passes.
- If there's schema to be shared between challenges package and http server and engine it should be stored in the shared directory
- DO NOT DUPLICATE PLEBBIT-js schemas or types, just import them from plebbit-js
- keep in mind that subplebbit.address can be a domain, and in that case if we need to get its public key we need to resolve it using plebbit-js library
- In general there should not be a need for dynamic imports, static imports should work
- No need to plan migration strategy for existing data. Assume we have no data on DB right now
- If you add or modify a column in the database schema (`packages/server/src/db/schema.ts`), remind me to delete the existing database file. The schema uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` which does not alter existing tables, so the old DB will be missing the new columns.
- When you make updates to how risk score is calculated you need to update packages/server/src/risk-score/RISK_SCORING.md when you do a git commit as well
- When you change anything under risk factors, run `npm run generate-scenarios` in packages/server to regenerate RISK_SCORE_SCENARIOS.md
- Keep in mind with risk scoring that author fields are all provided by user and not to be trusted fully, except for `author.subplebbit` which is generated by the subplebbit and can be trusted.
- Ideally everything should be typed properly, but if you can't please ask me and maybe I I can help you
- Keep in mind an author can be spamming with different author signers. Plebbit-js is psudeoanonymous after all
- When I report a bug or a problem you should try to replicate it in a test case first before fixing it.
- If you want to switch node version you can use `nvm`
- It's much more preferable when you write a function parameters to have them under a single arg within an object like {funcParam1, funcParam2} since it's more readable and can be easily updated
- There's usually no need to include new tables or columns, especially if we already have the value we need in a JSON column. If there's still a need, ask me and I will answer you.
- If you modify anything related to risk factor look into whether we need to change the script of `npm run generate-scenarios` to pick up the changes you did
